I am currently a first-year Computer Science Master's student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), focusing on backend/full-stack development. I completed my BS in Computer Science with first-class honors from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2024.

I interned as a backend developer at V Systems ([work account](https://github.com/YianW) here) in Hong Kong, developing e-commerce platforms and blockchain SDKs. Prior to this role, I served as a full-stack intern at Shanghai Huayi, building data analysis applications to support the companyâ€™s business operations.

I am now actively seeking a software engineering internship in the United States.

I love trees.
